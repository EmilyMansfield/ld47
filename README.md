# Unknot - Ludum Dare 47

Try and untie some knots, because that's usually a relaxing activity, right?

Controls are left-click only, and the fewer moves taken the better your score,
like golf I guess.

Created for Ludum Dare 47 with the theme 'Stuck in a loop'. While the player
being stuck in a loop may spring to mind, the interpretation here is that it's
the objects in the games that are loops. They can't be broken apart, but they
can be unravelled.

## Running

You can play the game in a sufficiently modern browser at
https://emilymansfield.github.io/ld47/, or can run the game directly through
the Godot editor using the project files and exporting to HTML5.

This is my first project in the Godot game engine, and while I'm not sure if a
Ludum Dare is the least stressful way to learn a new tool, Godot seems pretty
easy to pick up!
